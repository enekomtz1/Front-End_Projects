## Installation

No installation is required, as this is a standalone JavaScript function that can be run in any JavaScript environment, like a web browser's console or Node.js.

## Usage

To use the Pyramid Pattern Generator, call the `pyramid` function with an integer that represents the number of levels you want in your pyramid. For example, `pyramid(3)` will generate a pyramid with 3 levels.

```javascript
pyramid(n);
```

## Features

- Generates a centered pyramid pattern.
- The height of the pyramid is adjustable through the function parameter.
- Each level of the pyramid consists of '#' characters, and the number of '#' increases with each level.
- The pyramid is symmetric, with spaces on each side of the '#' characters.

## Examples

The following are examples of pyramid patterns with different levels:

1. A 2-level pyramid:

   ```
   pyramid(2);
   ```

   Output:

   ```
    #
   ###
   ```

2. A 3-level pyramid:

   ```
   pyramid(3);
   ```

   Output:

   ```
     #
    ###
   #####
   ```

3. A 4-level pyramid:

   ```
   pyramid(4);
   ```

   Output:

   ```
      #
     ###
    #####
   #######
   ```
