## Installation

No specific installation is required for this program as it is a straightforward JavaScript function. You can run it in any JavaScript environment like Node.js or browser console.

## Usage

To use the Step Pattern Generator, call the `steps` function with an integer argument representing the number of steps you want in your pattern. The function will then log the step pattern to the console.

```javascript
steps(3);
```

## Features

- **Simple Interface**: Just one function call is needed to generate the pattern.
- **Adjustable Size**: The size of the step pattern is dynamic and depends on the input parameter.
- **Console Output**: The pattern is displayed in the console, allowing for easy visualization and debugging.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how the function works:

- `steps(2)` produces:
  ```
  # 
  ##
  ```

- `steps(3)` produces:
  ```
  #  
  ## 
  ###
  ```

- `steps(4)` produces:
  ```
  #   
  ##  
  ### 
  ####
  ```
