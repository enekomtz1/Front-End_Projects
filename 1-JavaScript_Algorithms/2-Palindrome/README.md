# Palindrome Checker

## Introduction

The Palindrome Checker is a JavaScript utility designed to evaluate whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Installation

Since this script is written in JavaScript, it can be run in any JavaScript-enabled environment, including web browsers and Node.js. There are no specific installation steps required other than having a JavaScript runtime environment.

## Usage

To use the Palindrome Checker, include the function in your JavaScript codebase and call it with a string argument. The function will return `true` if the string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

```javascript
const isPalindrome = palindrome("yourStringHere");
console.log(isPalindrome); // Outputs: true or false
```

## Features

- **String Evaluation:** Checks if the input string is a palindrome.
- **Case Sensitivity:** Treats strings as case-sensitive, meaning "Abba" would not be considered a palindrome under the default configuration.

## Examples

Here are some example usages of the Palindrome Checker:

```javascript
console.log(palindrome("madam")); // Output: true
console.log(palindrome("kayak")); // Output: true
console.log(palindrome("hello")); // Output: false
```
