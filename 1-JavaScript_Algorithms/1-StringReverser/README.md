To use the string reverse algorithm, you just need to have a JavaScript environment set up, such as Node.js or a web browser console.

1. Clone this repository or download the source file.
2. Ensure you have a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js installed.

## Usage

To use the reverse function, you can call it with a string argument. Here is an example:

```javascript
const reversedString = reverse("Hello world!");
console.log(reversedString); // Outputs: "!dlrow olleH"
```

## Features

- **Simple Implementation:** The algorithm uses a straightforward approach to reverse strings.
- **Extensible:** The function can be easily integrated and extended within other JavaScript projects.
