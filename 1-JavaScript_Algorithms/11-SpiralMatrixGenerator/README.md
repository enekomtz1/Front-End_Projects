# Spiral Matrix Generator

## Introduction
The Spiral Matrix Generator is a JavaScript application that creates an NxN matrix, filled with numbers in a spiral order. Given an integer `n`, it generates a square matrix (n x n) where the numbers from 1 to nÂ² are arranged in a spiral pattern, starting from the top-left corner and spiraling inward in a clockwise direction.

## Installation
No installation is required, as this is a standalone JavaScript function that can be run in any JavaScript environment, like a web browser's console or Node.js.

## Usage
To use the Spiral Matrix Generator, simply call the `spiralMatrix(n)` function with your desired size `n`.

```javascript
spiralMatrix(3);
```

## Features
- Generates an NxN spiral matrix.
- Works efficiently for any size of `n`.
- Console logs the generated matrix for easy viewing.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how the Spiral Matrix Generator works:

1. For `n = 2`:
    ```javascript
    spiralMatrix(2);
    // Output:
    // [[1, 2],
    //  [4, 3]]
    ```

2. For `n = 3`:
    ```javascript
    spiralMatrix(3);
    // Output:
    // [[1, 2, 3],
    //  [8, 9, 4],
    //  [7, 6, 5]]
    ```

3. For `n = 4`:
    ```javascript
    spiralMatrix(4);
    // Output:
    // [[1, 2, 3, 4],
    //  [12, 13, 14, 5],
    //  [11, 16, 15, 6],
    //  [10, 9, 8, 7]]
    ```
