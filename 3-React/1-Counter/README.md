## Lessons Learned

1. **State Management:** The use of `useState` demonstrates how to manage and update component state in React, which is crucial for dynamic behavior.
2. **Event Handling:** Implementing `onClick` handlers shows how to respond to user actions like button clicks in a React application.
3. **Component Structure:** The example illustrates how to structure a React component functionally, including rendering UI and handling logic.
4. **CSS Integration:** Importing and applying CSS demonstrates how to style React components, separating concerns between functionality and appearance.
5. **Reactivity:** The code exemplifies React's reactive nature, where UI updates automatically in response to state changes.
