## Weather App

## Introduction
WeatherApp is a React-based application that allows users to search and display weather information for a specified city. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Custom icons are displayed to visually represent the current weather condition.

## Features
- Real-time weather data fetching using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Display of temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Dynamic weather icons that change according to the current weather condition.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices and screen sizes.

## Dependencies
- Vite
- React
- React Icons
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Configuration
The application requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data. This key is set in the `api_key` variable within the component. For production use, it is recommended to store this key securely, for example, in environment variables.

## Documentation
Further documentation on the API and other aspects of the application can be found at the OpenWeatherMap API documentation page.

## Troubleshooting
If the application does not display weather data, ensure that the API key is valid and has not exceeded its usage limits. Also, check network connectivity and the console for any potential errors.
